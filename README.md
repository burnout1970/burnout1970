- 👋 Hi, I’m @burnout1970
- 👀 I’m interested in why there is not an inches option to burn, when USA does not go by metric, mm or cm?? Although we did make a cigareete once that was a silly mm longer...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that when I design in inches using 72 dpi and then import into GRBL, it changes to cm! So inches to pixels/mm in graphic program then cm in GRBL. 
- WOW, Comeon... pleas give US the inches option when burning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collab with anyone who has a solution for US measurement. I built raceboats in Miami for years and never once used CM or MM. Not one sunk due to my mis-calculations!
